#Login Page

In computer security, logging in (or logging on, signing in, or signing on) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves.

The user credentials are typically some form of "username" and a matching "password" and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or a logon or a sign-in or a sign-on).

In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security.

I have made  just a simple login page for a website with database connectivity.

You have to install Xampp for that on your devices.

Then start the apache and mysql server.

You can use it as well in your project.
